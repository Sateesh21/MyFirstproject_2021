Hello allðŸ‘‹ !!
This is my first academic project called Real Time Facemask Detection by using Python and deep learning!!!

Details of files that are present in this repository:-
----------------------------------------------------


The "Requirements" file is an text file and it contains all the python Libraries which are used in this project. The second file is "DataSets" file it has two types of images which are with mask and without mask, 
this file used to train the face detection module and "Train_Mask_Detection.py" Has the relevant code. The third file is "Face_Detection" file is Used to recognise the faces By OpenCV module and 
"Detect_Facemask_by_CV2.py" has the relevant code for detection. And the last file was "project_plot.png" and it has the final output plot.
